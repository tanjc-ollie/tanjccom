          Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I’m Ollie, a curious soul
          from Toronto, Canada, where I find joy in peaceful cities filled with
          delicious food, shopping malls, and streets aglow with light. These
          places not only feel like home but also spark my creativity and
          curiosity.

          When I’m not working, you’ll find me exploring my passions—playing
          Nintendo Switch games like Legend of Zelda, wandering through malls
          and night streets, capturing the world through photography, or
          immersing myself in the magic of art galleries. These activities feed
          my love for exploration and detail.

          One of my most cherished memories is traveling solo to Singapore in
          2019, a journey that not only expanded my horizons but also deepened
          my understanding of myself. I’m constantly inspired by the interplay
          of people, art, and animals, all of which fuel my passion for
          creativity and connection.

          What makes me uniquely me? My deep self-awareness, a quality that
          helps me navigate life and relationships with authenticity. Right now,
          I’m excited to work on meaningful projects and find a career that I
          can truly devote myself to.

          or inspirations!
